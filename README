Here you can find a quick implementation of the algolia research toolbar where you can browse in all the wine you can have in your wine cellar. As you can see, if one of your bottle have a quality superior to 90, the wine will appear with a green border around.

For the display part, I've used the property below I have in my in my database :
- Name
- Year
- Quality

And I've used the picture binaries to display a visual representation of your bottle.

On the search criteria on the left, as you can see you can quickly filter your result by the different year you have in your cellar.

And to finish, as you can see you can provide different keyword to make a research in your content. At the bottom of the page, you can see the number of result your search have done and the time to complete it. For exemple, if you enter "Chateau Grand Puy Ducasse" in the search bar, you will only retrieve this products and the associated number (8 result in 1ms).
